# Rock Paper Scissors in Python!

## Pick your weapon and fight to death with the computer - you'll get nothing if you win!

Prerequisites: All you need is [Python3](https://www.python.org/) to play.

Clone the project, navigate to the correct diretory, - `cd directory name` - and run the `game.py` file in a Pyton Terminal window for macOS/Linux.

The rules are the same as the classic game:
1. Paper covers Rock
2. Scissors cuts Paper
3. Rock smashes Scissors

*Choose your weapon wisely!*

The computer chooses first, just follow the prompts.

Built with Python3.
